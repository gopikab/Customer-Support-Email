# Customer-Support-Email

Problem Statement:

Every company has a customer support team which takes care of all the queries correlated to the product of company or the company itself. This particular team is quite necessary to maintain the client relationships with the company and also to make sure that the company's brand value stands good and to make more and more customers to the company. This team works on various kinds of queries so that queries are not just definite. They have various kinds of queries for example, we have a product so some customers can send them a mail saying that our product is not working or product is not good may be it failed to work as they expected, may be the price is the problem or maybe they havenâ€™t got their refund and so on. 
  
The customer support team has to deal with n number of mails. Now in such scenario what happens is that a manual employee cannot reply to all those emails single-handedly, so any email that is sent to the customer support team must definitely have a reply back immediately to make sure there is a good client relationship with the company. Whenever you send a mail you get a reply back saying that the issue will be taken forward or will be looking into the issue as soon as possible and so on.
